			makes it easy to create an instrument from audio samples. Pass
			in an object which maps the note's pitch or midi value to the
			url, then you can trigger the attack and release of that note
			like other instruments. By automatically repitching the samples,
			it is possible to play pitches which were not explicitly
			included which can save loading time.
